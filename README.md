## Installation
___
To begin, make sure you install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) versions ***3.8 or better***. Because PyPresence library work only from version 3.8.
<br><br>
Upload or clone repositories (as you are more convenient). Install a **PyPresence** library through `PiP`.
```
pip install pypresence 
```
Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a **New Application**
<br>

<br>
<br>
Now it remains to add pictures, go to the **Rich Presence** tab on the portal and add anime avatar and the player icon (in the script folder it will). We change the name of the anime avatar on the `cover`, and the player icon on the `play`.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
If you have done right, you can safely run the script. Fill In Anime Data and Enjoy your updated Discord profile.
